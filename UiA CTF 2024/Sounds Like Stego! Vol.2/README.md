In this CTF challenge, from the Stego category, we were provided with a .wav file. This is part 2 of a 3-part series regarding this .wav file.

The first instinct for any audio steganography challenge is to open the audio file in a spectogram analysis tool, like audacity

After zooming in and changing the scale to Linear, we are met with the flag in the spectogram
